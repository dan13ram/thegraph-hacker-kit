Software required:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Npm packages `yarn global add truffle ganache-cli @graphprotocol/graph-cli`

## Additional resources:

- Run a Graph Indexer using Docker [pi0neerpat/indexer-docker-compose](https://github.com/pi0neerpat/indexer-docker-compose)
